Once the dough is formed, cover it with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let it rest for about 30 minutes. This will allow the gluten to relax and make the dough easier to work with.\\n6.

If using a pasta machine, start with the widest setting and gradually decrease the thickness until you reach the desired thickness for your pasta.\\n7. Once the dough is rolled out, you can cut it into your desired pasta shape. For example, you can make fettuccine, spaghetti, or lasagna sheets.\\n8. If making long pasta shapes like spaghetti, you can hang them on a pasta drying rack or lay them flat on a clean surface to dry for about 15-30 minutes before cooking.\\n9. To cook the pasta, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook until al dente, which means it should still have a slight bite to it. The cooking time will vary depending on the thickness and shape of the pasta, so it's best to taste it as it cooks.\\n10.

If using a pasta machine, start with the widest setting and gradually decrease the thickness until you reach the desired thickness for your pasta.\\n\\n7. Once the dough is rolled out, you can cut it into various pasta shapes like fettuccine, spaghetti, or lasagna sheets. You can use a sharp knife or a pasta cutter for this.\\n\\n8. As you cut the pasta, dust it with flour to prevent sticking. You can also hang the pasta on a drying rack or lay it flat on a clean surface until you're ready to cook it.\\n\\n9. To cook the pasta, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook it according to the package instructions or until it reaches your desired level of doneness. Fresh pasta usually cooks much faster than dried pasta, so keep an eye on it.\\n\\n10. Once cooked, drain the pasta and serve it with your favorite sauce or toppings.

After resting, divide the dough into smaller portions. You can use a pasta machine or a rolling pin to roll out the dough into thin sheets. If using a pasta machine, start with the widest setting and gradually decrease the thickness until you reach the desired thickness for your pasta.\\n\\n7. Once the dough is rolled out, you can cut it into various pasta shapes like fettuccine, spaghetti, or lasagna sheets. You can use a sharp knife or a pasta cutter for this.\\n\\n8. As you cut the pasta, dust it with flour to prevent sticking. You can also hang the pasta on a drying rack or lay it flat on a clean surface until you're ready to cook it.\\n\\n9. To cook the pasta, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook it according to the package instructions or until it reaches your desired level of doneness. Fresh pasta usually cooks much faster than dried pasta, so keep an eye on it.\\n\\n10. Once cooked, drain the pasta and serve it with your favorite sauce or toppings. Traditional Italian pasta dishes include carbonara, bolognese, marinara, or pesto.\\n\\nEnjoy your homemade Italian pasta!\",\n",
